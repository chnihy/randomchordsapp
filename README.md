# randomchordsapp
A random chord generation app using Kivy UI and the Mingus MIDI package 

Requires Kivy and Mingus, see dependencies.txt

Future plans:
- A prettier UI
- More control over chord choices, keys, progressions
- A dynamic interface that allows the user to change the order of the chords
- Control over sounds
- Playback with tracks
